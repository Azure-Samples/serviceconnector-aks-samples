Learn how to connect to Azure Key Vault using CSI driver in an AKS cluster with the help of Service Connector. In this tutorial, you complete the following tasks:

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> * Create an AKS cluster and an Azure Key Vault.
> * Create a connection between the AKS cluster and the Azure Key Vault with Service Connector.
> * Create a `SecretProviderClass` CRD and a `pod` consuming the CSI provider to test the connection.
> * Clean up resources.

## Prerequisites

* An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* [Install](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) the Azure CLI, and sign in to Azure CLI by using the [az login](/cli/azure/reference-index#az-login) command.
* Install [Docker ](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)and [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/), to manage container image and Kubernetes resources.
* A basic understanding of container and AKS. Get started from [preparing an application for AKS](../aks/tutorial-kubernetes-prepare-app.md).

## Create Azure resources

1. Create a resource group for this tutorial.

```azurecli
az group create \
    --name MyResourceGroup \
    --location eastus
```

2. Create an AKS cluster with the following command, or referring to the [tutorial](../aks/learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-cli.md). This is the cluster where we create the service connection, pod definition and deploy the sample application to.

```azurecli
az aks create \
    --resource-group MyResourceGroup \
    --name MyAKSCluster \
    --enable-managed-identity \
    --node-count 1
```

And connect to the cluster with the following command.

```azurecli
az aks get-credentials \
    --resource-group MyResourceGroup \
    --name MyAKSCluster
```

3. Create an Azure Key Vault with the following command, or referring to the [tutorial](../key-vault/general/quick-create-cli.md). This is the target service that is connected to the AKS cluster and the CSI driver synchronize secrets from.

```azurecli
az keyvault create \
    --resource-group MyResourceGroup \  
    --name MyKeyVault \
    --location EastUS
```

And create a secret in the Key Vault with the following command.

```azurecli
az keyvault secret set \
    --vault-name MyKeyVault \
    --name ExampleSecret \
    --value MyAKSExampleSecret
```

## Create service connection with Service Connector

#### Using Azure portal

Create a service connection between an AKS cluster and an Azure Key Vault with Azure portal, you may get started with Azure portal from the [quickstart](quickstart-portal-aks-connection.md). Fill in the settings with choices in the following tables, and leave other settings with their default values.

**Basics tab**

| Setting                   | Choice                     | Description                                                                               |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Service type**    | *Key Vault (enable CSI)* | Choose Key Vault as the target service type and check the option to enable CSI.           |
| **Subscription**    | `<MySubscription>`       | The subscription for your target service (Azure Key Vault).                               |
| **Connection name** | *keyvault_conn*          | Use the connection name provided by Service Connector or choose your own connection name. |
| **Key vault**       | `<MyKeyVault>`           | The target key vaultÂ you want to connect to.                                             |
| **Client type**     | *Python*                 | The code language or framework you use to connect to the target service.                  |

View the kubernetes resources created by Service Connector after the connection creation succeeds.

#### Using Azure CLI

Use the Azure CLI command to create a service connection to an Azure Key Vault, providing the following information:

- **Source compute service resource group name:** the resource group name of the AKS cluster.
- **AKS cluster name:** the name of your AKS cluster that connects to the target service.
- **Target service resource group name:** the resource group name of the Azure Key Vault.
- **Key vault name:** the Azure Key Vault that is connected.

```azurecli
az aks connection create keyvault --enalbe-csi
```

## Test the connection

1. Clone the sample repository:

   ```Bash
   git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/serviceconnector-aks-samples.git
   ```
2. Go to the repository's sample folder for Azure Key Vault:

   ```Bash
   cd serviceconnector-aks-samples/azure-keyvault-csi-provider
   ```
3. Replace the placeholders in the `secret_provider_class.yaml` file in the `azure-keyvault-csi-provider` folder.

   * Replace `<AZURE_KEYVAULT_NAME>` with the name of the key vault we created and connected. You may get the value from Azure portal of Service Connector.
   * Replace `<AZURE_KEYVAULT_TENANTID>` with the tenant ID of the key vault. You may get the value from Azure portal of Service Connector.
   * Replace `<AZURE_KEYVAULT_CLIENTID>` with identity client ID of the  `azureKeyvaultSecretsProvider` addon. You may get the value from Azure portal of Service Connector.
   * Replace `<KEYVAULT_SECRET_NAME>` with the key vault secret name we created, for example, `ExampleSecret`
4. Deploy the Kubernetes resources to your cluster with `kubectl apply `command. Install `kubectl` locally using the [az aks install-cli](/cli/azure/aks#az_aks_install_cli) command if it isn't installed.

   - Deploy the `SecretProviderClass` CRD.

   ```Bash
   kubectl apply -f secret_provider_class.yaml
   ```

   - Deploy the `pod `. The command creates a pod named `sc-demo-keyvault-csi` in the default namespace of your AKS cluster.

   ```Bash
   kubectl apply -f pod.yaml
   ```
5. Check the deployment is successful by viewing the pod with `kubectl`.

   ```Bash
   kubectl get pod/sc-demo-keyvault-csi
   ```
6. After the pod starts, the mounted content at the volume path specified in your deployment YAML is available. Use the following commands to validate your secrets and print a test secret.

   - Show secrets held in the secrets store using the following command.

   ```Bash
   kubectl exec sc-demo-keyvault-csi -- ls /mnt/secrets-store/
   ```

   - Display a secret in the store using the following command. This example command shows the test secret `ExampleSecret`.

   ```Bash
   kubectl exec sc-demo-keyvault-csi -- cat /mnt/secrets-store/ExampleSecret
   ```

## Clean up resources

Clean up the Azure resources in this tutorial by deleting the resource group.

```azurecli
az group delete \
    --resource-group MyResourceGroup
```
