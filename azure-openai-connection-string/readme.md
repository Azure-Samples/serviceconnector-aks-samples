Learn how to create a pod in an AKS cluster, which talks to an Azure OpenAI service using connection string. In this tutorial, you complete the following tasks:

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> * Create an AKS cluster and an Azure OpenAI service with `gpt-4` model deployment.
> * Create a connection between the AKS cluster and the Azure OpenAI service with Service Connector.
> * Clone a sample application that will talk to the Azure OpenAI service from an AKS cluster.
> * Deploy the application to a pod in AKS cluster and test the connection.
> * Clean up resources.

## Prerequisites

* An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* [Install](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) the Azure CLI, and sign in to Azure CLI by using the [az login](/cli/azure/reference-index#az-login) command.
* Install [Docker ](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)and [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/), to manage container image and Kubernetes resources.
* A basic understanding of container and AKS. Get started from [preparing an application for AKS](../aks/tutorial-kubernetes-prepare-app.md).
* Access permissions to [create Azure OpenAI resources and to deploy models](../ai-services/openai/how-to/role-based-access-control.md).

## Create Azure resources

1. Create a resource group for this tutorial.

```azurecli
az group create \
    --name MyResourceGroup \
    --location eastus
```

2. Create an AKS cluster with the following command, or referring to the [tutorial](../aks/learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-cli.md). The cluster is where we create the service connection, pod definition and deploy the sample application to.

```azurecli
az aks create \
    --resource-group MyResourceGroup \
    --name MyAKSCluster \
    --enable-managed-identity \
    --node-count 1
```

And connect to the cluster with the following command.

```azurecli
az aks get-credentials \
    --resource-group MyResourceGroup \
    --name MyAKSCluster
```

3. Create an Azure OpenAI service with the following command, or referring to the [tutorial](../ai-services/openai/how-to/create-resource.md). This is the target service that is connected to the AKS cluster and sample application interacts with.

```azurecli
az cognitiveservices account create \
    --resource-group MyResourceGroup \
    --name MyOpenAIService \
    --location eastus \
    --kind OpenAI \
    --sku s0 \
    --custom-domain myopenaiservice \
    --subscription <SubscriptionID>
```

And deploy a model with the following command. The model is used in the sample application to test the connection.

```azurecli
az cognitiveservices account deployment create \
    --resource-group MyResourceGroup \
    --name MyOpenAIService
    --deployment-name MyModel \
    --model-name gpt-4 \
    --model-version 0613 \
    --model-format OpenAI \
    --scale-settings-scale-type Standard
```

4. Create an Azure container registry with the following command, or referring to the [tutorial](../container-registry/container-registry-get-started-portal.md). The registry hosts the container image of the sample application, which the AKS pod definition consumes.

```azurecli
az acr create \
    --resource-group MyResourceGroup \
    --name MyRegistry \
    --sku Standard
```

And enable anonymous pull so that the AKS cluster can consume the images in the registry.

```azurecli
az acr update \
    --resource-group MyResourceGroup \
    --name MyRegistry \
    --anonymous-pull-enabled
```

## Create service connection with Service Connector

#### Using Azure portal

Create a service connection between an AKS cluster and an Azure OpenAI service with Azure portal, you may get started with Azure portal from the [quickstart](quickstart-portal-aks-connection.md). Fill in the settings with choices in the following tables, and leave other settings with their default values.

**Basics tab**

| Setting                   | Choice                | Description                                                                               |
| ------------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Service type**    | *OpenAI Service*    | The target service type.                                                                  |
| **Subscription**    | `<MySubscription>`  | The subscription for your target service (Azure OpenAI service).                          |
| **Connection name** | *openai_conn*       | Use the connection name provided by Service Connector or choose your own connection name. |
| **OpenAI**          | `<MyOpenAIService>` | The target Azure OpenAI serviceÂ you want to connect to.                                  |
| **Client type**     | *Python*            | The code language or framework you use to connect to the target service.                  |

**Authentication tab**

| Authentication Setting        | Choice                | Description                            |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Authentication type** | *Connection String* | Service Connector authentication type. |

View the kubernetes resources created by Service Connector after the connection creation succeeds.

#### Using Azure CLI

Use the Azure CLI command to create a service connection to the Azure OpenAI service, providing the following information:

- **Source compute service resource group name:** the resource group name of the AKS cluster.
- **AKS cluster name:** the name of your AKS cluster that connects to the target service.
- **Target service resource group name:** the resource group name of the Azure OpenAI service.
- **OpenAI service name:** the Azure OpenAI service that is connected.

```azurecli
az aks connection create openai --secret
```

## Clone sample application

1. Clone the sample repository:

   ```Bash
   git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/serviceconnector-aks-samples.git
   ```
2. Go to the repository's sample folder for Azure OpenAI:

   ```Bash
   cd serviceconnector-aks-samples/azure-openai-connection-string
   ```
3. Replace the  `<MyModel>` placeholder in the  `app.py` file with the model name we deployed.

## Build and push container image

1. Build and push the images to your container registry using the Azure CLI [`az acr build`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/acr#az_acr_build) command.

```azurecli
az acr build --registry <MyRegistry> --image sc-demo-openai-connstr:latest ./
```

2. View the images in your container registry using the [`az acr repository list`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/acr/repository#az_acr_repository_list) command.

```azurecli
az acr repository list --name <MyRegistry> --output table
```

## Run application and test connection

1. Replace the placeholders in the `pod.yaml` file in the `azure-openai-connection-string` folder.

   * Replace `<YourContainerImage>` with the image name we build in last step, for example, `<MyRegistry>.azurecr.io/sc-demo-openai-connstr:latest`.
   * Replace `<SecretCreatedByServiceConnector>` with the secret created by Service Connector after the connection creation. You may check the secret name in the Azure portal of Service Connector.
2. Deploy the pod to your cluster with `kubectl apply` command. Install `kubectl` locally using the [az aks install-cli](/cli/azure/aks#az_aks_install_cli) command if it isn't installed. The command creates a pod named `sc-demo-openai-connstr` in the default namespace of your AKS cluster.

   ```Bash
   kubectl apply -f pod.yaml
   ```
3. Check the deployment is successful by viewing the pod with `kubectl`.

   ```Bash
   kubectl get pod/sc-demo-openai-connstr
   ```
4. Check connection is established by viewing the logs with `kubectl`.

   ```Bash
   kubectl logs pod/sc-demo-openai-connstr
   ```

## Clean up resources

Clean up the Azure resources in this tutorial by deleting the resource group.

```azurecli
az group delete \
    --resource-group MyResourceGroup
```
